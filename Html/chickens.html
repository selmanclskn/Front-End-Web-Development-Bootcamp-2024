      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that
      arose from the red junglefowl, originally from
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia">Southeast Asia</a>.
      They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl
      (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster
      and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called
      a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female
      bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
      Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
      meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for
      cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens
      domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.

    <p>
      Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with
      a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2] up from more than 19
      billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
      There are numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore, and
      religion, as well as in language and literature.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Biddy: a newly hatched chicken</li>
      <li>Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken</li>
      <li>Chick: a young chicken</li>
      <li>Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)</li>
      <li>Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken
      Islands).[20] In fact, chicken was originally a term only for an immature,
      or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, and still often in trade
      and scientific contexts, chicken as a species are typically referred to as
      common fowl or domestic fowl.[21]

    <h2>Biology and habitat</h2>
    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <p>
      Chickens are omnivores.[26] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to
      search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large as lizards, small
      snakes,[27] or sometimes young mice.[28] The average chicken may live for
      5–10 years, depending on the breed.[29] The world's oldest known chicken
      lived for 16 years, according to Guinness World Records.[30]
    </p>
    <h2>Courtship</h2>
    <p>
      To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a
      hen (a circle dance), often lowering the wing which is closest to the
      hen.[39] The dance triggers a response in the hen[39] and when she
      responds to his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the
      mating.
    </p>
    <p>More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Male approaching the hen</li>
      <li>Male pre-copulatory waltzing</li>
      <li>Male waltzing</li>
      <li>
        Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away
        (if unwilling to copulate)
      </li>
      <li>Male mounting</li>
      <li>Male treading with both feet on hen's back</li>
      <li>Male tail bending (following successful copulation)[40]</li>
    </ol>
